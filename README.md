# DEDIS Bibliography

This repository holds the shared .bib files commonly used in most DEDIS papers.

Other repositories containing actual papers should generally use symlinks
to refer to the .bib files in this repository to avoid divergence.
This can easily be done in either of the following ways:

-	By including this `bib` repository as a submodule in the paper repo,
	as is done in the master `dedis/papers` repository for example.
- 	By having the project-specific repository simply expect the bib repo
	to have been checked out next to it in the directory structure.

Both approaches are reasonable and left to the choice of a particular project.
